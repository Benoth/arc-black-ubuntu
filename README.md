# Arc Darker Ubuntu

Not really a coder, but this is my attempt at making the arc-theme at bit more unity-friendly.

This theme is build with GTK3.18 in mind, so it's for Ubuntu unity 16.04 ONLY.

Theme is a fork of https://github.com/horst3180/arc-theme/

The only changes I made is to disable transparency, delete all non-unity stuff, using the arc-darker theme, I made it so menus are blue/white insted of white/black, which made some problems for the unity topbar - icons would not show in the correct color. Fixet GTKcalendar a bit and other unity-stuff.

If you have more suggestions feel free to ask or make pull-requests.

Thanks to horst3180 for his wonderful theme.
