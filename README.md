# Arc Darker Ubuntu

Not really a coder, but this is my attempt at making the arc-theme at bit more unity-friendly.

This theme is build with GTK3.18 in mind, so it's for Ubuntu unity 16.04 ONLY. - If you dont like OSX icons,  you  can use the orignals with the "non-OSX" branch.

Theme is a fork of https://github.com/horst3180/arc-theme/ - Thanks to horst3180 for his wonderful theme.

If you have more suggestions feel free to ask or make pull-requests.

# Changes made

- Disable transparency
- Add OSX icons
- Delete all non-unity stuff
- Made menus blue/white insted of white/black, which made some problems for the unity topbar - icons would not show in the correct color.
- Fixet GTKcalendar a bit
- Fixet sound-buttons in unity-panel
- Made scrollbar for terminal dark
- Other unity-stuff.
