# Arc Darker Ubuntu

Not really a coder, but this is my attempt at making the arc-theme at bit more unity-friendly.

This theme is build with GTK3.18 in mind, so it's for Ubuntu unity 16.04. 

This is still work in progress, but I think it's almost done. Just have small things to fix, see here: https://github.com/horst3180/arc-theme/issues/471

Thanks to horst3180 for his wonderful theme.
